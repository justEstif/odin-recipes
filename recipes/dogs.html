    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meringue Bun
            <ol>
                <li>Start by separating 3 egg whites into a large bowl and add an ⅛ tsp of cream tartar to the whites
                    before using a wire whisk to whip the whites into a foam. This will take 1-2 minutes on medium high
                    speed. I recommend using a stand mixer for this. </li>
                <li>Make sure your pre-measured granulated sugar is free of lumps and prepare your food coloring. To get
                    a nice light brown, add 3 drops of red and yellow food color while adding 2 drops of blue. Tweak
                    this to whatever color you desire. </li>
                <li>Slowly add ⅓ cup of sugar while the mixer runs on medium speed. Once all the sugar has been added,
                    increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat the egg whites until they have reached stiff peaks.
                    This is a good time to add any last minute changes to the color. Beat the egg whites for 3-5 minutes
                    until smooth and glossy and they form stiff peaks.</li>
                <li>To form the meringue into buns, bend cannoli rolls open a little bit so they can stand on their own
                    and then cover with aluminum foil. Spread the meringue across the molds until it resembles an
                    inverted hot dog bun. </li>
                <li>Place into a 225℉ oven for 2 ½ hours. Do not open the oven door, even when they are done. They need
                    to sit in the oven until the whole oven has cooled off completely.</li>
                <li>Once removed from the oven, remove the aluminum foil from the “bun” very carefully, as they are
                    extremely fragile. Once everything has been removed, set aside until ready to assemble. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough
            <ol>
                <li>Add 1 stick butter, ¼ cup white sugar, ¾ cup brown sugar and 1 large egg into a large mixing bowl
                    and mix until combined before adding 1 cup all-purpose flour, ¼ tsp baking soda and 1 tsp kosher
                    salt. </li>
                <li>Add roughly 6oz of finely chopped bittersweet chocolate and mix until combined. Mold the dough into
                    the shape of hot dogs. </li>
                <li>Cover with plastic wrap and place the “hot dogs” in the freezer for about 1 hour to completely
                    solidify.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Cherry Ketchup
            <ol>
                <li>Start off by using a chopstick to pit 1 cup of cherries and put them into a blender. Blend to
                    extract the juices from the cherries.</li>
                <li>Once the extracting is finished, strain with a strainer or cheesecloth into a small sauce pan. Add
                    the harvested pits to the strainer since they contain a lot of juice. Press into the sieve until you
                    have nothing left except for a bunch of cherry pulp. </li>
                <li>Place the pan with the juices onto the stove top with a couple tablespoons of sugar, depending on
                    how sweet your cherries were to start with. Whisk together, and once everything has cooked and
                    dissolved, it’s time to thicken. </li>
                <li>Put a few tablespoons of the cherry mixture into a small bowl and add 1 tablespoon or cornstarch.
                    Whisk together until it forms a slurry. Add the slurry to the sauce pan and simmer for 2-3 minutes
                    until nice and thick.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Caramel Mustard
            <ol>
                <li>For the caramel mustard, add ⅓ cup water and 1 cup sugar to a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer
                    without stirring. All the sugar should dissolve and it should resemble a nice amber color after
                    about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>At this point, kill the heat and add ¾ cup of heavy cream while whisking constantly. Keep whisking
                    until it's nice and smooth. After cooling off for 1-2 minutes, add 2 Tbsp of butter and whisk to
                    combine. Make sure to season the caramel by adding a generous pinch of salt and mix it all together.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Batter to Deep Fry Cookie Dough
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add 1 cup of all-purpose flour, ½ tsp each of baking soda and kosher salt, ¾
                    cup of sugar and whisk to combine before adding 1 ¼ cup of milk.</li>
                <li>Stir together and until no lumps remain and it resembles a very thin pancake batter. Adjust with
                    more milk and/or flour as necessary. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Dessert Dog Assembly
            <ol>
                <li>Retrieve the cookie dough “hot dogs” from the freezer and place them in the batter, covering every
                    inch of the cookie dough. Place it in a large pot filled with 1 quart of vegetable oil heated to
                    375℉.</li>
                <li>Let each cookie dough log fry for 2-4 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Place the “hot dog” cookie dough log delicately into the meringue bun and drizzle with the cherry
                    ketchup and caramel mustard.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
